# Connect 4 GUI

This program is a GUI implementation of the popular Connect 4 board game, allowing a human player to play against a random computer player. To win, a player must place 4 of their pieces in a row (horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally) before their opponent. To run the program, ensure that you are in the root directory of the project and run *./gradle bootRun* if on MacOS *./gradlew bootRun* if on Windows.
